# PlateSync Developer Notes

This document contains essential information for developers working on the PlateSync application. It serves as a reference for various workflows, integration details, and special handling required by the application.

## Latest Fixes - Subscription & Authentication System

### ✅ TRIAL EXPIRATION SYSTEM COMPLETED (May 24, 2025)
**Feature**: Complete subscription management with trial expiration handling and expired subscription page.

**Functionality**:
1. **Trial Status Detection**: System automatically detects when 30-day trial period expires
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: 
   - Account Owners with expired trials can only access subscription-related pages
   - Administrators and Standard Users are completely blocked from expired accounts
3. **Expired Subscription Page**: Dedicated page with PlateSync branding and subscription options
4. **Payment Integration**: Subscription buttons connect to Global Admin configured Stripe payment links

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Middleware Protection**: `checkTrialExpiration` middleware applies to all protected routes
- **Public Payment API**: `/api/stripe/payment-links` endpoint provides payment links without authentication
- **New Tab Navigation**: Payment links open in new tabs to prevent Stripe skeleton loading issues
- **Subscription Cards**: Monthly plan ($2.99) with "Most Popular" badge, Annual plan ($25.00) with "Best Value" badge

**UI/UX Features**:
- Centered enlarged PlateSync logo with consistent branding
- Side-by-side subscription card layout with aligned buttons
- Clear messaging about trial expiration and upgrade requirements
- Red "Sign Out" button for easy logout access

**Database Structure**:
- `trial_end_date` field in subscriptions table tracks 30-day trial period
- Subscription status calculated dynamically based on current date vs trial end date
- Payment links stored in Global Admin Stripe integration settings

**Page Routing & Access Control**:
- `/expired-subscription` route only accessible when trial is expired AND user is Account Owner
- Middleware redirects expired Account Owners to this page automatically
- Other user roles (Admin/Standard) completely blocked from expired accounts
- System automatically redirects back to dashboard when trial becomes active again

**Troubleshooting Notes**:
- Stripe skeleton loading issue fixed by opening payment links in new tabs instead of current window
- Payment links fetched from `/api/stripe/payment-links` public endpoint (no auth required)
- Trial period can be extended by updating `trial_end_date` in subscriptions table
- System immediately detects trial status changes without requiring restart

### ✅ CHURCH STATUS DATA INTEGRITY ISSUE RESOLVED (May 24, 2025)
**Issue**: Churches table showed records with "DELETED" status while still being functional in the system.

**Root Cause**: Global Admin interface filters to show only "ACTIVE" status churches by default, but database records had incorrect "DELETED" status.

**Solution**: Updated church status from "DELETED" to "ACTIVE" to match actual system functionality.

**Prevention**: Always verify church status consistency when debugging Global Admin visibility issues.

### ✅ LOGOUT FUNCTIONALITY FIXED (May 24, 2025)
**Issue**: Session destruction was causing crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'regenerate')" error during logout process.

**Root Cause**: ReplitAuth system was conflicting with local authentication system, causing session management issues.

**Solution**:
1. **Completely disabled ReplitAuth system** by renaming `server/replitAuth.ts` to `server/replitAuth.ts.DISABLED`
2. **Enhanced logout handler** with proper error handling and session checks in `server/routes.ts`
3. **Improved session cleanup** with cookie clearing and proper error handling

**Result**: 
- ✅ Server logs now show "Logout endpoint called - destroying session"
- ✅ Server logs show "Session destroyed and cookies cleared" 
- ✅ Users are properly redirected to login page after registration completion
- ✅ No more authentication system conflicts or crashes
- ✅ Registration flow now works perfectly: Complete registration → Click "Go to Sign In" → Logout → Login page

**Technical Details**:
- Logout endpoint handles both GET and POST requests
- Session destruction is wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Cookie clearing happens before session destruction
- Proper redirect logic for different request types

## Planning Center Integration

PlateSync integrates with Planning Center Online (PCO) to import member data. The integration uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and API access.

### OAuth Authentication Flow

The Planning Center integration requires careful handling of the OAuth flow:

1. **Essential Requirements:**
   - Use a spawned tab approach (`target="_blank"`) for desktop browsers
   - Use direct navigation for mobile browsers to avoid iframe issues
   - Include special OAuth parameters to force re-authentication when needed
   - Store a churchId parameter throughout the flow to maintain context
   - Configure the correct callback URL in both Planning Center application settings and PlateSync's environment variables
   - Store the OAuth state parameter in the user session for security validation

2. **Implementation Details:**
   ```tsx
   // Example of correct implementation with device detection
   const connectToPlanningCenter = async () => {
     // Detect device type
     const isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
     
     // Get auth URL from server
     const response = await fetch('/api/planning-center/auth-url?device=' + 
       (isMobile ? 'mobile' : 'desktop'));
     const data = await response.json();
     
     if (isMobile) {
       // Mobile: use direct navigation
       window.location.href = data.url;
     } else {
       // Desktop: use spawned tab
       window.open(data.url, '_blank');
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Flow Sequence:**
   - User clicks "Connect to Planning Center"
   - Client detects device type and stores churchId in localStorage/sessionStorage
   - Server generates a secure OAuth URL with multiple parameters:
     - `prompt=login` to force login dialog
     - `max_age=0` to require fresh authentication
     - Unique `nonce` and timestamp to prevent caching
   - Planning Center displays the authorization screen
   - Upon approval, Planning Center redirects to our callback URL with code
   - The server exchanges the code for tokens
   - The callback page sends a message to the opener window (desktop) or redirects (mobile)

### Token Management

Planning Center access tokens expire after 2 hours, while refresh tokens are valid for 90 days.

- **Token Storage:**
  - Store both access and refresh tokens securely in the database
  - Associate tokens with both user ID and church ID
  - Include expiration timestamp to know when to refresh
  - Store churchId in multiple places for redundancy (URL parameters, session, localStorage)

- **Token Refresh:**
  - Check token expiration before making API calls
  - Automatically refresh when tokens are expired
  - Handle refresh token failures gracefully with clear user feedback
  
- **Token Revocation (Disconnect):**
  - Revoke both access token AND refresh token with Planning Center
  - Use proper OAuth token revocation format (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)
  - Include client_id, client_secret and token parameters in revocation request
  - Clean up all temporary and permanent token storage after revocation
  - Clear client-side storage (localStorage, sessionStorage) during disconnect
  - Implement a short delay (2 seconds) after disconnect before allowing reconnect

### Troubleshooting Planning Center Integration

If users experience issues with Planning Center integration, try the following:

1. **From PlateSync side:**
   - Use the "Disconnect" button to properly revoke tokens with Planning Center
   - Wait for the 2-second delay to complete before attempting to reconnect
   - Check server logs for OAuth flow issues or token revocation errors
   - Verify user permissions (must be ADMIN)

2. **From Planning Center side:**
   - If the connection appears stuck, go to Planning Center Online → Account Settings → Integrations → External Connections
   - Click "Disconnect" for PlateSync, then try connecting again
   - This forces Planning Center to treat it as a new authorization request
   
3. **Mobile Device Authentication Issues:**
   - Mobile browsers handle redirect flows differently than desktop browsers
   - If users see raw JSON or "Please wait..." messages:
     - They should use the "Continue to PlateSync" button on the redirect page
     - Check browser cache settings - try clearing browser cache if persistent
     - Try using different mobile browsers (Chrome works well)
   - Common mobile-specific issues:
     - Redirect flow gets stuck in a loop
     - Authorization completes but shows JSON response instead of redirecting
     - Auth flow appears successful but tokens aren't claimed properly
     - Authorization page displays but doesn't show as connected in settings
   - Our solution includes multiple fallback mechanisms:
     - Form-based redirects (more reliable than location.href on mobile)
     - Manual "Continue to PlateSync" button with timeout
     - Fetch API preloading to prime connections
     - URL/form parameter duplication for cache-busting
     - Redundant churchId storage in both localStorage and sessionStorage

4. **Technical Implementation Details:**
   - Device-specific handling is essential:
     - Desktop: Use spawned tab approach (`target="_blank"`) for authorization
     - Mobile: Use direct navigation to avoid iframe and window.open issues
   - OAuth token revocation must use proper form URL-encoded format
   - Include client_id AND client_secret when revoking tokens
   - Always check both client and server logs when debugging connection
   - Aggressive OAuth parameters used (prompt=login, max_age=0, nonce) to force re-authentication
   - 2-second delay implemented between disconnect and reconnect attempts
   - Multiple timestamp parameters added to beat aggressive mobile browser cachingissues

4. **Known Issues and Solutions:**
   - **Authentication Persistence**: Planning Center may maintain login session cookies across disconnects
     - Solution: Use `prompt=login`, `max_age=0` and `nonce` OAuth parameters to force re-authentication
   - **Mobile Browser Redirection**: Mobile browsers handle new windows/tabs differently
     - Solution: Detect mobile devices and use direct navigation instead of window.open
   - **Token Revocation Failures**: Incorrect format in revocation requests
     - Solution: Use form URL-encoded content type with all required parameters
   - **Lost Context Between Domains**: churchId may be lost during redirects
     - Solution: Store churchId in multiple places (URL, session, localStorage)

## Authentication

PlateSync implements multiple authentication methods:

1. **Replit Auth (OpenID Connect):** Primary authentication method for production
2. **Local Authentication:** For development and testing

User roles include:
- ADMIN: Full access to all features
- USHER: Limited access to donation counting features
- MASTER_ADMIN: Special role for church-wide settings
- ACCOUNT_OWNER: Special role for the main administrator of a church account
- STANDARD_USER: Basic user with limited permissions based on assigned church
- GLOBAL_ADMIN: Super-admin role with access to the entire system

---

## User Management

PlateSync provides a comprehensive user management system for adding and managing users. The process includes email verification and password setup.

### Adding New Users

1. **User Addition Flow:**
   - Navigate to the User Management screen
   - Click "Add User" button
   - Fill in required fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, and Role
   - System sends a welcome email with verification link
   - User clicks the verification link to set up their password
   - User can then log in with their email and password

2. **Welcome Email Process:**
   - System uses the configured email template from the database
   - Email includes dynamic variables:
     - `{{firstName}}`: User's first name
     - `{{lastName}}`: User's last name
     - `{{role}}`: User's role (formatted for readability, e.g., "Standard User")
     - `{{verificationLink}}`: Link to verify email and set password
     - `{{churchName}}`: Church organization name

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Welcome emails are sent using SendGrid API
   - Verification tokens expire after 48 hours (configurable)
   - Password requirements include minimum 8-character length
   - Passwords are securely hashed using scrypt before storage

### Email Verification and Password Setup

1. **Verification Process:**
   - User receives email with verification link
   - Link format: `/verify?token=<verification_token>`
   - User sets a password (minimum 8 characters)
   - System validates the token and updates user record
   - User is marked as verified in the database

2. **Technical Implementation:**
   ```typescript
   // Sample verification endpoint implementation
   app.post('/api/auth/verify-email', async (req, res) => {
     const { token, password } = req.body;
     
     // Basic validation
     if (!token || !password) {
       return res.status(400).json({ message: "Token and password are required" });
     }
     
     try {
       // Find user with this token
       const user = await findUserByResetToken(token);
       
       // Validate token and password
       if (!user || user.passwordResetExpires < new Date()) {
         return res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid or expired token" });
       }
       
       // Validate password strength
       if (password.length < 8) {
         return res.status(400).json({ message: "Password must be at least 8 characters long" });
       }
       
       // Update user record
       await updateUserVerification(user.id, password);
       
       return res.status(200).json({ message: "Email verified and password set successfully" });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Error during verification:", error);
       return res.status(500).json({ message: "An error occurred while verifying your email" });
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If users don't receive verification emails, check:
     - Spam/junk folders
     - Correct email address in the system
     - SendGrid API configuration and limits
   - If verification fails, check:
     - Token expiration (default 48 hours)
     - Password requirements (minimum 8 characters)
     - Database connection and update permissions

## Database Structure

PlateSync uses a PostgreSQL database with the following key tables:

- `users`: User accounts and authentication
- `members`: Church members who make donations
- `donations`: Individual donation records
- `batches`: Groups of donations collected during a service
- `planningCenterTokens`: Stores OAuth tokens for Planning Center integration
- `emailTemplates`: Customizable email templates for various notifications

See `shared/schema.ts` for complete database schema definitions.

---


## Email Templates

PlateSync uses an email template system that allows for both system-wide default templates and church-specific customized templates. Templates are stored in the database and used by the SendGrid email integration.

### Email Template Types

PlateSync supports the following email template types:

1. **WELCOME_EMAIL**: Sent to new users when they are invited to the system
   - Template ID 1: System default with PlateSync logo (church_id: 40829937)
   - Template ID 5: Alternative version with text logo (church_id: 40829937)

2. **PASSWORD_RESET**: Sent when a user requests a password reset
   - Template ID 2: Professional design with PlateSync logo (church_id: 644128517)

3. **DONATION_CONFIRMATION**: Sent to donors after their donation is recorded
   - Template ID 3: Receipt template with church logo (church_id: 40829937)

4. **COUNT_REPORT**: Sent to designated recipients when a donation batch is finalized
   - Template ID 4: Report template with church logo (church_id: 40829937)

### Template Structure

Each email template contains:

- `id`: Unique identifier in the database
- `template_type`: Type of email (e.g., 'WELCOME_EMAIL', 'PASSWORD_RESET', etc.)
- `subject`: Email subject line with optional variable placeholders
- `body_text`: Plain text version of the email content
- `body_html`: HTML version of the email with styling
- `church_id`: Associated church ID (determines which template is used)

### Template Assignment and Usage

Templates are assigned to specific churches through the `church_id` field:

1. **Template Lookup Process**:
   - When sending an email, PlateSync first searches for a template matching the required type AND the specific church_id
   - If no church-specific template is found, it falls back to a system default template
   - If no template is found at all, it uses hardcoded fallback templates in the code

2. **Logo Usage**:
   - Templates with IDs 1 and 2 use the PlateSync logo (`https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/676190801265eb0dc09c3768/739cc76d-9a1c-49b8-81d4-debf5f1bb208/PlateSync+Logo.png`)
   - Template 5 uses the text-based version of the logo (`https://platesync.replit.app/logo-with-text.png`)
   - Donation and count report templates can display the church's own logo

### Password Reset Email Flow

When a user requests a password reset:

1. The system looks for a PASSWORD_RESET template in the user's church (church_id from user record)
2. If found, it uses that template (with the church's custom design)
3. If not found, it uses template ID 2 (with the PlateSync logo)
4. The template variables (like `{{resetUrl}}`) are populated with real values
5. The email is sent via SendGrid from the configured sender email

### Email Template Management

Templates can be managed through the API:

- `GET /api/email-templates`: List all templates for the church
- `GET /api/email-templates/:id`: Get a specific template
- `POST /api/email-templates`: Create a new template
- `PATCH /api/email-templates/:id`: Update an existing template
- `GET /api/email-templates/type/:type`: Get template by type

Only ADMIN users can manage email templates for their church.

### Important Notes

1. The template with ID 2 (PASSWORD_RESET) is specifically assigned to church_id 644128517 to ensure all users receive a professional password reset email with the PlateSync logo
2. Template customization should preserve the variables (enclosed in double curly braces) to ensure dynamic content works correctly
3. To test email templates, use the `/api/test-email` endpoint which sends a test email without affecting real data
=======
## Church Logo Management

Proper handling of church logos is essential to ensure all users within a church organization see the same branding.

### Logo Storage and Synchronization

1. **Dual Storage Strategy:**
   - **Local Storage:** Church logos are stored in the `/public/logos` directory on the server filesystem
   - **Cloud Storage:** Logos are also uploaded to AWS S3 bucket (`repl-plates-image-repo`) for reliable email delivery
   - **Database Reference:** The relative path to the logo (e.g., `/logos/church-logo-123456789.png`) is stored in the `church_logo_url` column in the `users` table
   - **Consistency:** Every user associated with a church must have the same logo URL in their user record

2. **Logo Upload and Storage Flow:**
   - When an Account Owner uploads a new church logo:
     - Logo is saved locally to `/public/logos/{timestamp}-{random}.png`
     - Same logo is uploaded to AWS S3 bucket with a matching key
     - The logo URL in the database uses a relative path (`/logos/filename.png`) for web display
     - S3 URL is used for email templates to ensure consistent display across email clients
     - The same logo URL is propagated to all users with the same `church_id`

3. **S3 Integration Details:**
   - AWS Region is automatically extracted from environment variables
   - S3 bucket name is defined in AWS_S3_BUCKET environment variable
   - S3 keys follow the same naming convention as local files for consistency
   - S3 service provides fallback to local URL if S3 upload fails

4. **Implementation Details:**
   ```sql
   -- SQL query to synchronize logo URL across all users in a church
   UPDATE users 
   SET church_logo_url = '/logos/church-logo-example.png' 
   WHERE church_id = '12345';
   ```

5. **Display Optimization:**
   - **Cache Busting:** Logo URLs include timestamp query parameters to prevent browser caching issues
   - **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for logo loading failures with clean fallback to church name
   - **Relative Paths:** Web app displays use relative paths for more reliable internal routing
   - **Absolute URLs:** Email templates use S3 URLs for better cross-client compatibility

6. **Common Issues and Solutions:**
   - **Issue:** Logo appears for Account Owner but not for other users
     - **Solution:** Ensure the logo URL is copied to all users with the same `church_id`
   - **Issue:** Logo disappears after user profile updates
     - **Solution:** Preserve the `church_logo_url` field during any user record updates
   - **Issue:** Different users see different logos
     - **Solution:** Run a synchronization query to update all users in the church
   - **Issue:** Logo appears in web app but not in emails
     - **Solution:** Verify S3 upload was successful and ONLY the S3 URL is being used in email templates
     - **Critical:** Emails must exclusively use S3 URLs for logos (not Replit domain URLs)
   - **Issue:** Logo fails to load in certain browsers
     - **Solution:** Use cache-busting query parameters and check image content type headers

7. **Technical Implementation:**
   - The SharedNavigation component uses cache-busting query parameters to display the current logo
   - The s3.ts service handles upload to AWS with proper error handling and region configuration
   - The settingsRoutes.ts handles the multi-destination storage approach
   - The sendgrid.ts email service prioritizes S3 URLs for reliable email image display

8. **Email Logo URL Guidelines (CRITICAL):**
   - **NEVER use Replit domain URLs in emails** - they will not display properly in most email clients
   - **ALWAYS use AWS S3 URLs for any images in email templates** - this is non-negotiable for reliable delivery
   - The correct URL format is: `https://{AWS_S3_BUCKET}.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/{filename}.png`
   - Features to maintain email logo integrity:
     - Strict validation of logo URLs before including in emails (must contain 's3.amazonaws.com')
     - Direct database querying for logo URLs to bypass any code-level URL rewriting
     - Clear fallback to text-only display if valid S3 URL isn't available
     - Database logo URLs should already contain absolute S3 URLs - never try to rewrite them
   - Code locations to check if logo issues recur:
     - server/sendgrid.ts: Contains email generation with logo URL handling
     - server/index.ts: Defines base URL used for database migrations
     - server/storage.ts: Contains critical email template generation code
     - server/upload-platesync-logo.ts: Updates image URLs in email templates

## Planning Center Mobile Authentication Flow

For a proper mobile authentication experience with Planning Center, the following workflow was implemented:

### Enhanced Device Detection and Context Persistence

1. **Dual Device Detection:**
   ```javascript
   // Client-side detection
   const isMobileUserAgent = /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
   
   // Server-side detection (from response)
   const serverDetectedMobile = response.deviceType === 'mobile';
   
   // Final determination using both sources
   const finalIsMobile = isMobileUserAgent || serverDetectedMobile;
   ```

2. **Multiple Storage Mechanisms:**
   ```javascript
   // Store churchId in both localStorage and sessionStorage for redundancy
   localStorage.setItem('planningCenterChurchId', churchId);
   sessionStorage.setItem('planningCenterChurchId', churchId);
   
   // Store device type in session
   sessionStorage.setItem('planningCenterDeviceType', isMobile ? 'mobile' : 'desktop');
   
   // Add timestamp for cache-busting
   localStorage.setItem('planningCenterAuthTimestamp', Date.now().toString());
   ```

3. **Device-Specific Navigation:**
   ```javascript
   if (finalIsMobile) {
     // Mobile: Use form-based redirect with additional parameters
     // Form submission is more reliable than direct window.location on mobile
     const form = document.createElement('form');
     form.method = 'get';
     form.action = '/settings';
     // Add all parameters as hidden form fields
     // ...
     document.body.appendChild(form);
     form.submit();
   } else {
     // Desktop: Open in new tab with simpler parameters
     window.open(data.url, '_blank');
   }
   ```

### Preventing Cache Issues

1. **Multiple Cache-Busting Techniques:**
   ```javascript
   // Add timestamp parameter to URL
   redirectUrl += `&t=${Date.now()}`;
   
   // Add random cache-busting parameter for mobile
   redirectUrl += `&cachebust=${Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000)}`;
   
   // Use different parameter names to avoid collisions
   const extraTimestamp = Date.now() + 1;
   redirectUrl += `&ts=${extraTimestamp}`;
   ```

2. **Explicit Cache Control Headers:**
   ```javascript
   // Server-side cache prevention headers
   res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0');
   res.setHeader('Pragma', 'no-cache');
   res.setHeader('Expires', '0');
   ```

### Advanced Mobile Flow

1. **Form-Based Redirection:**
   Instead of using `window.location.href` for redirection, we use a form submission approach which is more reliable on mobile devices:
   ```javascript
   // Create and submit a form
   const form = document.createElement('form');
   form.method = 'get';
   form.action = '/settings';
   
   // Add parameters as hidden form fields
   for (const [key, value] of urlParams.entries()) {
     const input = document.createElement('input');
     input.type = 'hidden';
     input.name = key;
     input.value = value;
     form.appendChild(input);
   }
   
   document.body.appendChild(form);
   form.submit();
   ```

2. **Fetch API Preloading:**
   ```javascript
   // "Prime" the connection using fetch API before actual navigation
   fetch(redirectUrl, { 
     method: 'GET',
     headers: { 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache' },
     mode: 'same-origin'
   }).then(() => {
     // Proceed with form redirect after fetch completes or fails
     // ...
   });
   ```

3. **Manual Fallback Button:**
   For cases where automatic redirection fails, we show a manual redirect button after a delay:
   ```javascript
   // Show manual redirect button after delay (shorter for advanced mobile flow)
   const buttonDelay = isAdvancedMobileFlow ? 2000 : 4000;
   setTimeout(() => {
     const button = document.getElementById('manualRedirectButton');
     button.style.display = 'block';
     
     // Make button more prominent for advanced mobile flow
     if (isAdvancedMobileFlow) {
       button.style.fontSize = '1.2rem';
       button.style.padding = '14px 28px';
       button.style.boxShadow = '0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)';
     }
   }, buttonDelay);
   ```

### Error Handling and Recovery

1. **Extended Token Claim Retries:**
   ```javascript
   // More retries for mobile devices with longer backoff
   const maxRetries = isMobile ? 5 : 3;
   let retries = 0;
   
   while (retries < maxRetries) {
     try {
       // Attempt the operation
       // ...
     } catch (error) {
       // Progressive backoff with longer delays for mobile
       const backoffTime = isMobile ? (1500 * retries) : (1000 * retries);
       await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoffTime));
       retries++;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Device-Specific Error Messages:**
   ```javascript
   // For mobile devices, add extra help text and longer toast duration
   if (isMobileDevice) {
     errorTitle = "Mobile Connection Failed";
     errorMessage += " Ensure you're using the same device throughout the process.";
     
     toast({
       title: errorTitle,
       description: errorMessage,
       variant: "destructive",
       duration: 8000, // Longer for mobile
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Storage Cleanup on Error:**
   ```javascript
   // Clear all Planning Center related items from storage on error
   if (isMobileDevice) {
     sessionStorage.removeItem('planningCenterDeviceType');
     sessionStorage.removeItem('planningCenterMobileDevice');
     localStorage.removeItem('planningCenterChurchId');
     sessionStorage.removeItem('planningCenterChurchId');
     localStorage.removeItem('planningCenterAuthTimestamp');
   }
   ```

## Profile Image Upload Implementation

PlateSync implements a file-based profile image system using the following best practices:

### Server-Side Implementation

1. **Storage Configuration:**
   - Store profile images in the `public/avatars` directory with public access
   - Use timestamp-based unique filenames to prevent collisions
   - Clean up old profile images when users upload new ones

2. **Route Structure:**
   - Dedicated routes for both regular and global admin profiles
   - Proper middleware for file handling and validation
   - Example implementation:

   ```javascript
   // Example file upload middleware configuration
   const upload = multer({
     storage: multer.diskStorage({
       destination: (req, file, cb) => {
         const avatarsDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public/avatars');
         // Ensure directory exists
         if (!fs.existsSync(avatarsDir)) {
           fs.mkdirSync(avatarsDir, { recursive: true, mode: 0o777 });
         }
         cb(null, avatarsDir);
       },
       filename: (req, file, cb) => {
         // Generate unique filename using timestamp and original extension
         const timestamp = Date.now();
         const fileExtension = file.originalname.split('.').pop();
         const uniqueFilename = `avatar-${timestamp}-${Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000000)}.${fileExtension}`;
         cb(null, uniqueFilename);
       }
     }),
     limits: {
       fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 // Limit to 5MB
     },
     fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
       // Only allow images
       if (!file.mimetype.startsWith('image/')) {
         return cb(new Error('Only image files are allowed'));
       }
       cb(null, true);
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Image Processing:**
   - Return relative URL paths to keep URLs consistent across environments
   - Cleanup old images when users upload new ones
   - Example code for returning profile image data:

   ```javascript
   // Example route handler for profile image upload
   app.post('/api/profile/avatar', upload.single('avatar'), async (req, res) => {
     try {
       // Validation
       if (!req.file) {
         return res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: 'No file uploaded' });
       }
       
       // Generate relative path to file
       const relativeFilePath = `/avatars/${req.file.filename}`;
       
       // Generate full URL for client convenience
       const fullUrl = `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}${relativeFilePath}`;
       
       // Save the profile image URL to user's profile in database
       // ... Database code here ...
       
       // Get old profile image path to delete it
       const oldImagePath = user.profileImageUrl;
       if (oldImagePath) {
         const oldImageFullPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', oldImagePath);
         // Delete old profile image if it exists
         if (fs.existsSync(oldImageFullPath)) {
           fs.unlinkSync(oldImageFullPath);
           console.log('Deleted old profile image:', oldImageFullPath);
         }
       }
       
       // Return success with both relative and full URLs
       return res.json({
         success: true,
         message: 'Profile picture updated successfully',
         profileImageUrl: relativeFilePath,
         fullImageUrl: fullUrl
       });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error uploading profile image:', error);
       return res.status(500).json({
         success: false,
         message: 'Failed to update profile picture'
       });
     }
   });
   ```

### Client-Side Implementation

1. **Image Upload:**
   - Use a file input with proper MIME type validation
   - Implement size constraints (5MB limit)
   - Hide the actual file input and use a button to trigger it
   - Example:

   ```tsx
   // Create hidden file input with ref
   const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
   
   // Trigger file input click
   const triggerFileInput = () => {
     fileInputRef.current?.click();
   };
   
   // Handle file selection and validation
   const handleFileChange = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     const file = event.target.files?.[0];
     if (!file) return;
     
     // Validate file type
     if (!file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
       toast({
         title: 'Error',
         description: 'Please upload an image file',
         variant: 'destructive',
       });
       return;
     }
     
     // Validate file size
     if (file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
       toast({
         title: 'Error',
         description: 'Image file size must be less than 5MB',
         variant: 'destructive',
       });
       return;
     }
     
     // Upload the file
     uploadAvatarMutation.mutate(file);
     
     // Reset input for reuse
     event.target.value = '';
   };
   ```

2. **Upload Handling with FormData:**
   - Use FormData for multipart/form-data uploads
   - Add proper authentication tokens if needed
   - Example implementation with React Query:

   ```tsx
   // Upload avatar mutation
   const uploadAvatarMutation = useMutation({
     mutationFn: async (file: File) => {
       setIsUploading(true);
       
       const formData = new FormData();
       formData.append('avatar', file);
       
       // Get authentication token if needed
       const token = localStorage.getItem("authToken");
       
       // Use fetch with proper headers
       const response = await fetch('/api/profile/avatar', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: {
           'Authorization': token ? `Bearer ${token}` : '',
           'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'
         },
         body: formData
       });
       
       if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error("Failed to upload profile picture");
       }
       
       return await response.json();
     },
     onSuccess: (data) => {
       // Update profile data with new image URL
       setProfileData(prev => ({
         ...prev,
         profileImageUrl: data.profileImageUrl
       }));
       
       toast({
         title: 'Success',
         description: 'Profile picture updated successfully',
       });
     },
     onError: (error) => {
       toast({
         title: 'Error',
         description: error.message || 'Failed to update profile picture',
         variant: 'destructive',
       });
     },
     onSettled: () => {
       setIsUploading(false);
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Image Display with Cache Busting:**
   - Use cache-busting technique to prevent stale images
   - Implement fallback for failed image loads
   - Example:

   ```tsx
   <Avatar className="w-24 h-24">
     {profileData.profileImageUrl ? (
       <AvatarImage 
         src={`${profileData.profileImageUrl}?t=${Date.now()}`} 
         alt="Profile" 
         onError={(e) => {
           console.error("Image failed to load:", profileData.profileImageUrl);
           // Force fallback if image fails to load
           (e.target as HTMLImageElement).style.display = 'none';
         }}
       />
     ) : (
       <AvatarFallback className="bg-primary text-white text-xl">
         {profileData.firstName && profileData.lastName 
           ? `${profileData.firstName[0]}${profileData.lastName[0]}`
           : "U"}
       </AvatarFallback>
     )}
   </Avatar>
   ```

### Important Considerations

1. **Folder Permissions:**
   - The `public/avatars` directory must have write permissions for the server (777)
   - Add this directory to version control but ignore its contents

2. **Cache-Busting:**
   - Always add a timestamp query parameter to image URLs
   - Update image URLs in state with the timestamp to force re-render

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Provide fallback display when images fail to load
   - Check for file existence before deletion to prevent errors

4. **Static File Serving:**
   - Ensure Express is configured to serve static files from the public directory:
   ```javascript
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'public')));
   ```

5. **Storage Choice:**
   - For production, consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, etc.)
   - For development and smaller deployments, file-based storage is simpler

## Data Integrity & Registration Cache Issues

### Logo Cache Contamination Fix (May 24, 2025)

**Problem:** New church registrations were displaying logos from previously registered churches due to improper data caching and automatic syncing.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Authentication Logo Syncing:** The `/api/auth/user` endpoint automatically synced existing church logos to new users during authentication
2. **localStorage Cache Persistence:** Browser localStorage retained logo preview data (`onboardingLogoPreview`) between registrations
3. **Cross-Church Data Leakage:** New church accounts would inherit visual assets from completely different organizations

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Disabled Authentication Syncing:**
   - Modified `/api/auth/user` endpoint to prevent automatic logo syncing during authentication
   - Added explicit prevention of logo contamination with detailed logging
   - Only allows church name syncing when appropriate, never logos

2. **Comprehensive Cache Clearing:**
   - Component initialization: Clears all cached logo data when onboarding starts
   - Step-specific clearing: Double-clears cached data when entering logo upload step
   - localStorage cleanup: Removes `onboardingLogoPreview` and resets all logo-related state

3. **Data Isolation Enforcement:**
   - Each church registration now starts with completely clean state
   - Prevents visual identity contamination between different church organizations
   - Ensures proper separation of church branding assets

**Code Changes:**
- `server/routes.ts`: Lines 3916-3947 - Replaced automatic logo syncing with contamination prevention
- `client/src/pages/onboarding.tsx`: Added component-level and step-level cache clearing

**Result:** New church registrations now display blank logo upload areas as intended, with complete data isolation between church accounts.
