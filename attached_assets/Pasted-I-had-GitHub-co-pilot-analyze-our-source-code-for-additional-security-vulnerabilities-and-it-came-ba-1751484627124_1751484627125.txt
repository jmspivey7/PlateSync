I had GitHub co-pilot analyze our source code for additional security vulnerabilities and it came back with what it thought were 3 CRITICAL issues regarding: Type confusion through parameter tampering.  I think it pulled these from the shared/security.ts file, but I may be wrong about that.  Please review the “suggested” fixes that GitHub provides below and let me know if you concur with these findings or if you disagree.  Don’t make any code changes yet, just come back to me with your opinions and thoughts so we can consider the impact of these issues.

(01) To fix the issue, the validateUrlParameter function should include a runtime type check to ensure that the value parameter is a string before performing any operations on it. This prevents type confusion attacks where value could be an array or another unexpected type. Specifically:
1. Add a type check (typeof value === 'string') at the beginning of the function.
2. If the type check fails, log a warning and return null to indicate invalid input.

(02) To fix the issue, the validateUrlParameter function should include a runtime type check to ensure that the value parameter is a string before performing any operations on it. If the type is not a string, the function should return null or handle the input appropriately. This prevents type confusion attacks and ensures the function operates as intended.
Steps to implement the fix:
1. Add a type check at the beginning of the validateUrlParameter function to verify that value is a string.
2. If value is not a string, log a warning and return null.
3. Ensure the rest of the function logic remains unchanged.

(03) To fix the issue, we need to ensure that req.query.token is a string at runtime before using it. This can be achieved by adding a type check for token and rejecting requests where token is not a string. This approach prevents type confusion attacks and ensures the application behaves as expected.
Steps to fix:
1. Add a runtime type check for token to verify it is a string.
2. If token is not a string, return a 400 Bad Request response with an appropriate error message.
3. Ensure the type check is performed before any operations involving token.
